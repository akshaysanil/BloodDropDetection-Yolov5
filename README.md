# BloodDropDetection-Yolov5
## I have developed a custom object detection model using YOLOv5, which is pre-trained on a large dataset of images and then fine-tuned to specifically detect blood drops in different contexts, such as walls, floors, and clothes. The model was then deployed using Flask, a Python web framework, to create an API that allows users to send images or videos to the server for detection.

## Additionally,  I have integrated the model with a camera to enable real-time detection. This means that the model can process the video stream from the camera in real-time and provide instant feedback on the presence and location of blood drops.

## To use the model, users can send images or videos to the Flask API, which will process the input and return the detected results. The model has been trained to accurately detect blood drops in various scenarios, and its real-time capabilities make it a useful tool for a variety of applications.

Overall, this custom object detection model using YOLOv5 and Flask API is a powerful tool for detecting blood drops in different contexts and is an excellent example of how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems.
